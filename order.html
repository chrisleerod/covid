            <p>To combat the spread of COVID-19, the Metro Public Health Department has issued a Safer at Home Order
                directing all residents of Nashville and Davidson County to stay inside their homes unless they are
                engaged in certain “essential activities.”</p>
            <br>
            <span>Mayor Cooper announced March 31 the extension of the Safer at Home Order to April 24 to further
                contain and combat the spread of the coronavirus in Davidson County.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                When you are outside of your home for necessary tasks, please remember to stay at least 6 feet away from
                others and practice healthy hand and respiratory hygiene.
