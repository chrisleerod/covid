                    <p>A coronavirus is a virus that is common among people and animals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The coronavirus you are hearing about — COVID-19 — is a respiratory illness that can spread from
                        person to person. It was first discovered in China in late 2019.

                <div class="ac-a">
                    <p>The severity of the illness varies from person to person.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For many people, the virus will not lead to any serious complications or hospitalization, but
                        some cases can lead to pneumonia or even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which
                        requires a patient to be put on a ventilator with oxygen. If the lungs are damaged and
                        insufficient oxygen reaches the rest of the body, respiratory failure can lead to organ failure
                        and death.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        People with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions (such as heart disease,
                        liver disease, diabetes, or respiratory illness) and those older than 60 are most at risk of
                        serious infection.</p>

            <div class="ac">
                <h2 class="ac-q" tabindex="0">How is COVID-19 spread?</h2>
                <div class="ac-a">
                    <p>The virus is spread mainly from person-to-person contact – like shaking hands – and through
                        respiratory droplets produced when someone with the virus sneezes or coughs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The virus can remain on objects or surfaces touched by someone with COVID-19. If you touch a
                        contaminated object or surface and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, the virus can spread to
                        you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Most early cases of COVID-19 in the United States were associated with travel in countries where
                        the virus was more prevalent. Increasingly, however, the virus is “community-acquired” — caught
                        through close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

                    <p>We do not have enough information to state definitively whether pregnant women are at increased
                        risk of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing more severe illness as a result of COVID-19.
                        Pregnant women should take usual preventive actions to avoid infection.</p>

                <div class="ac-a">
                    <p>Current information suggests that children are at lower risk for serious illness from COVID-19
                        than the general population. However, children could inadvertently pass the virus to others,
                        including older adults and people with long-term medical conditions.</p>

                    <p>There is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. People with pets and
                        people who work with animals should engage in usual preventive actions to avoid infection, like
                        hand washing and respiratory hygiene.</p>
